# What is prometheus ?

Prometheus is a system monitoring and alerting system. It was opensourced by SoundCloud in 2012 and was incubated by Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Prometheus stores all the data as time series, i.e metrics information is stored along with the timestamp at which it was recorded, optional key-value pairs called as labels can also be stored along with metrics. 

# What are metrics and why is it important for your applications?

Metrics in layman terms is a standard for measurement. What we want to measure depends from application to application. For a web server it can be request times, for a database it can be CPU usage or number of active connections etc. 

Metrics play an important role in understanding why your application is working in a certain way. If you run a web application and someone comes up to you and says that the application is slow. You will need some information to find out what is happening with your application. For example the application can become slow when the number of requests are high. If you have the request count metric you can spot the reason and increase the number of servers to handle the heavy load. Whenever you are defining the metrics for your application you must put on your detective hat and ask this question **what all information will be important for me to help debug if any issue occurs in my application?**

Analogy: I always use this analogy to simply understand what a monitoring system does. When I was young I wanted to grow tall and to measure it I used height as a metric. I asked my dad to measure my height everyday and keep a table of my height on each day. So in this case my dad is my monitoring system and the metric was my height.

# Basic Architecture of Prometheus

The basic components of prometheus are:
- Prometheus Server (The server which scraps and stores the metrics data).
- Client Library which is used to calculate and expose the metrics.
- Alert manager to raise alerts based on preset rules.
(Note: Apart from this prometheus has push gateways which I am not covering here).

So there is an application for example let us consider it to be a web server. I want to extract certain metric like the number of api calls processed by my web server. So I add certain instrumentation code using the prometheus client library and expose the metrics information. Now that my web server also exposes its metrics I want it to be scraped by prometheus. So I run prometheus in separately and configure it to fetch the metrics from the web server which is listening on xyz IP address port 7500 at specific time interval say every minute. 


I set prometheus up and expose my web server accessible for the frontend or other client to use.


At 11:00 PM when I make my web server open to consumption. Prometheus scrapes the count metric and stores the value as 0

By 11:01 PM one request is processed by my web server . The instrumentation logic in my code makes the count to 1. When prometheus scraps the metric the value of count is 1 now

By 11:02 PM two requests are processed by my web server and the request count is 1+2 = 3 now. Similarly metrics are scraped and stored

The user can control the frequency at which metrics are scraped by prometheus


Time Stamp | Request Count (metric)
-----------| -------------
11:00 PM   | 0
11:01 PM   | 1
11:02 PM   | 3

(Note: This table is just a representation for understanding purposes. Prometheus doesnâ€™t store the values in the exact format)

Prometheus also has a server which exposes the metrics which are stored by scraping. This server is used to query the metrics, create dashboards/charts on it etc.

A simple Line chart created on my Request Count metric will look like this

I can scrape multiple metrics which will be useful to understand what is happening in my application and create multiple charts on them. Group the charts into a dashboard and use it to understand what is happening in my application.
